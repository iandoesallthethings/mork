# IFP header definitions for AGiliTy 1.1.1.
#
# The AGT game file format comes in two types.  The original format is
# a whole cluster of files.  One of these is game.d$$, and this always
# begins with ".. >> Temporary...".  Once found, we can invoke the inter-
# preter with the path to this file, and it will strip the unwanted
# extension and run the right game.  The other format is AGX, as defined
# by AGiliTy.  This is easier to spot - it begins "58 C7 C1 51".
