This directory contains the resampler code that comes with the opus-tools
package from the Opus codec distribution:

  http://www.opus-codec.org

Version of opus-tools: 0.2

The Opus resampler is a modified version of the resampler that comes with the
Speex codec. Although you can substitute this resampler with the one from Speex,
the results will be less than satisfactory, since the version provided by Opus
contains bugfixes for audio quality problems in the original Speex code.
Therefore, it is not recommended to "unbundle" the code provided here and link
against the Speex resampler, as this will result in very audible distortion when
resampling audio from/to specific sample rates (44.1kHz to 96kHz, for example.)
