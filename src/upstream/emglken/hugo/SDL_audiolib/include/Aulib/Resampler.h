     * The 'src' buffer contains audio in either mono or stereo. Stereo is
     * stored in interleaved format.

     * The source and target sample rates, as well as the amount of channels
     * that are to be used must be those that were specified in the last call
     * to the adjustForOutputSpec() function.
     *
     * 'dstLen' and 'srcLen' are both input as well as output parameters. The
     * function must set 'dstLen' to the amount of samples that were actually
     * stored in 'dst', and 'srcLen' to the amount of samples that were
     * actually used from 'src'. For example, if in the following call:
     *
     *      dstLen = 200;
     *      srcLen = 100;
     *      doResampling(dst, src, dstLen, srcLen);

     * the function resamples 98 samples from 'src', resulting in 196 samples
     * which are stored in 'dst', the function must set 'srcLen' to 98 and
     * 'dstLen' to 196.
     *
     * So when implementing this function, you do not need to worry about using
     * up all the available samples in 'src'. Simply resample as much audio
     * from 'src' as you can in order to fill 'dst' as much as possible, and if
     * there's anything left at the end that cannot be resampled, simply ignore
     * it.
